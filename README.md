# EDMC-Triumvirate
The Triumvirate plug-in for EDMC, developed by Close Encounters Corps (KAZAK0V, AntonyVern), is a powerful data-processing tool that allows you to track the influence of the fraction in the controlled systems, pinpoint tasks for each system, collect scientific data, coordinate the work of pilots, notify colleagues about emergency situations in long-haul flights and collect statistics on Thargoids and anomalies. In the future, the plugin will receive a number of improvements designed to make it even easier for pilots to work in the vast expanses of the Galaxy.

***Confidential user information, user system features and non-public personal data are not collected, stored or processed as a matter of principle.***

# Please pay attention:

The Triumvirate plugin is categorically NOT compatible with EDMC-Canonn, EDMC-USS-Survey and the outdated EDMC-USS-Survey-Triumvirate-edition plugins. EDMC-Canonn was originally integrated into Triumvirate.

# Plug-in functions (will be updated as improvements are made)

## Element for accepting commands from the user

### Command /sos

After the pilot writes a command "/sos" (in any register) in the game chat, the plugin will form and send to the Discord-chat * (in a specially dedicated channel) a data packet with the location, fuel amount, place and time before the tank was emptied. Thanks to this data, a pilot in a dangerous situation will be able to deliver fuel and refuel on time.

\* If you are an independent pilot (according to the plugin), your request for help will be forwarded to Close Encounters Corps faction.

## Orientation System Element (aka Patrol)

The orienteering system is used for navigation when flying to points of interest and includes: 
 * System for tracking the influence levels of fractions in the systems under control of specific faction. This tool provides a brief information summary on the status in systems with the presence of our fractions. There is a function for factional leaders to manually assign tasks to specific systems to be issued directly into the plug-in.
 * Dislocation of your ships. A tool that provides real-time information on the location of your ships. The addition of a compass/GPS-like feature is being developed to provide a clear flight path to points of interest.
* The addition of a function to provide information about the location of your carrier, the list of its characteristics and the filling of fuel tanks is being developed.
* We are working on adding an " friendly-foe" feature to the identification system to determine who is in front of you - co-operate, ally or opponent/neutral.
