# EDMC-Triumvirate
The Triumvirate plugin for EDMC, developed by Close Encounters Corps (KAZAK0V, AntonyVern), is a powerful data-processing tool that allows you to track the influence of the fraction in the controlled systems, pinpoint tasks for each system, collect scientific data, coordinate the work of pilots, notify colleagues about emergency situations in long-haul flights and collect statistics on Thargoids and anomalies. In the future, the plugin will receive a number of improvements designed to make it even easier for pilots to work in the vast expanses of the Galaxy.

***Confidential user information, user system features and non-public personal data are not collected, stored or processed as a matter of principle.***

# Please pay attention:

The Triumvirate plugin is categorically NOT compatible with EDMC-Canonn, EDMC-USS-Survey and the outdated EDMC-USS-Survey-Triumvirate-edition plugins. EDMC-Canonn plugin was originally integrated into Triumvirate, we also integrated support for Discord Presence, FCMC and transfer of collected scientific data not only to Canonn servers, but also to ATEL-IGAU addresses, operates a system of issuing and accounting of completed missions in the context of activities against the Club.

# Plug-in functions (will be updated as improvements are made)

## Element for accepting commands from the user

### Command /sos

After the pilot writes a command "/sos" (in any register) in the game chat, the plugin will form and send to the Discord-chat * (in a specially dedicated channel) a data packet with the location, fuel amount, place and time before the tank was emptied. Thanks to this data, a pilot in a dangerous situation will be able to deliver fuel and refuel on time.

\* If you are an independent pilot (according to the plugin), your request for help will be forwarded to Close Encounters Corps faction.

## Orientation System Element (aka Patrol)

The orienteering system is used for navigation when flying to points of interest and includes: 
 * System for tracking the influence levels of fractions in the systems under control of specific faction. This tool provides a brief information summary on the status in systems with the presence of our fractions. There is a function for factional leaders to manually assign tasks to specific systems to be issued directly into the plug-in.
 * Dislocation of your ships. A tool that provides real-time information on the location of your ships. The addition of a compass/GPS-like feature is being developed to provide a clear flight path to points of interest.
* The addition of a function to provide information about the location of your carrier, the list of its characteristics and the filling of fuel tanks is being developed.
* We are working on adding an " friendly-foe" feature to the identification system to determine who is in front of you - co-operate, ally or opponent/neutral.
 
## News node element

Allows you to see the latest news and current information on the Galaxy.

## Report element on Thargoid intercepts

Allows you to collect and analyse information about the time and place where the Thargoids intercepted your ships. Provides an accurate estimate of the scale of the alien invasion.

## NHSS Reporting Element

Collects and analyzes information about detected alien (read  "Thargoid") signals.

## Element of FSS report analysis

Collects and analyzes complete information about the current system.

## Codex Element

Collects information from log entries and synchronizes it with external services such as[Canonn database] (https://api.canonn.tech/documentation).

## Thargoid elimination analysis element

Collects and processes information about the time, location, type and number of Thargoid ships shot down. Serve to summarize the week and build a clear plan to counter the alien invasion.

## Element to analyse information from the pilot's log
Collects and processes information from the pilot's log. Provides updates on markets, products and prices. Helps all pilots get the latest data. Transmits the obtained information to the profile websites INARA, EDSM, EDDB and so on.
